Here is the current folder structure of my project:

/project
    /docs
        overview.pdf
        readme.md
    /scripts
        data_cleaning.py
        analysis.py
    /images
        logo.png
        chart.png
    /archive
        old_report.zip
    notes.txt
    todo_list.txt

How can I organize these files and folders for better management?
